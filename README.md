# EduToons: AI-Driven Educational Animation Platform

![home_page](docs/home2.png)

## Academic Research Project

EduToons is an innovative e-learning platform that transforms traditional teaching materials into engaging animated content using advanced AI technologies.
This research project addresses the challenge of maintaining young learners' interest in online education through the integration of voice cloning and animation technologies.

## üéØ Research Objectives

- Develop an AI-driven system for creating interactive and engaging learning experiences
- Transform traditional teaching content into animated character-based lessons
- Implement voice cloning technology for authentic character voicing
- Create an interactive learning environment with real-time Q&A capabilities

## üî¨ Technical Implementation

### Voice Conversion System

- **RVC Model**: Utilizes Retrieval-based Voice Conversion for voice conversion
- **HuBERT Integration**: Implements Hidden-Unit BERT model for feature extraction
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Objective Metrics**:
    1. RMSE of log(f0) (logF0_RMSE)
    2. Mean MCEP
  - **Subjective Metrics**:
    1. Mean Opinion Score (MOS)

### Video Processing Pipeline

![vidoe_pipline](docs/video_pipline.png)

- **Motion Capture**: MediaPipe for pose estimation and landmark detection
- **3D Animation**: Blender integration for character rigging and animation
- **Character Rendering**: Custom pipeline for seamless character animation

### Web Platform Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Authentication**: Clerk.js
- **Database**: MySQL for data management
- **Backend**: Flask-based API services

## üìä Experimental Results

### Dataset Characteristics

- Custom-created educational video dataset
- Duration: 10-20 seconds per video
- Focus on full-body visibility and simple movements
- Content: Educational lessons and stories for children

### Performance Evaluation

- **Does Animation Actually Help Children ?**:

  - **Survey**:
    Due to time constraints, we were unable to conduct an experimental study in local schools. Instead, we surveyed our siblings.
    Despite a potential bias, they responded enthusiastically to the concept of a cartoon character teaching and answering their questions.

- **Voice Conversion Quality**:
  ![Mean_MCEP_for_Dimension](docs/Mean_MCEP_for_Dimension.png)

  - logF0_RMSE: 0.2
  - MOS scale (survey): 4.1
